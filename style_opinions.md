# Ellen's style opinions

4/30

Test on the lib!

- GameMenuRunning
  - Make killcode smaller
  - Add spacing between things
  - Make kill code a normal input
  - Add space between the buttons
- JoinGameEnterName
  - Request to enter name should be smaller
- GameMenuWaiting
  - Move game name to top   
  
4/29
- JoinGameEnterCode
  - We should have a message to users that game codes come from the creator
  - We may also want to make the game code input box bigger
- CreateGame seems fine
- JoinGameEnterName
  - I don't think it should show the game code on this screen. I think the game title should be small, "Enter your name" should be larger, and the instructions below it should be slightly larger
- GameMenuWaiting
  - The text should have slightly more padding at the top
  - I think the size of the game name is fine as a subtitle
  - Game Rules seems fine, but we should fix it's size and make it scrollable (low priority)
  - Player list seems fine
  - Maybe we should have instructions for the creator to pass out the game code???
- Victory
  - You won should be centered and have a smaller text size so it fits on one line
  - Ideally we'd make this more exciting (think animations) but we may not have time
- GameMenuRunning
  - The screen seems fine before you get someone
  - Kill Code should be in a text style box so we can see it as things to write on
  - There should be brief instructions on how to use a kill code when you press got target, maybe above the text input box
  - There should be some space between the verify kill code and cancel buttons
