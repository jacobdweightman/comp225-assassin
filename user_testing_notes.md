# Notes from user tests

## User MG, 4/28
- Immediately understood that you needed a _game code_ in order to join a game
- Submitted forms to join a game flawlessly, no confusion there
- Didn't understand _They Got Got_ button's meaning, thought that it meant the other player was already dead
  - Didn't realize it was a button to press
- Didn't understand what the _Kill Code_ was or why it would be needed, or that they had one
- The text input on inputting a _Kill Code_ is not clear, it doesn't force numbers only and has no box to show where to put numbers
- They were underwhelmed with the victory screen
- They understood creating the game
- Wasn't clear they would need to share the _game code_
- Was annoyed by confirmation to start the game
- The screen it takes you to if you're the only player in a game was very confusing, they didn't know what to do from there (I think this screen should just show the victory screen)
